# ResXML

## What is ResXML?

ResXML is an XML application for the presentation-oriented markup of
resumes or curricula vitae. The aim is for ResXML to support a set of
features which make it a very functional tool for generating resumes
for actual use from an XML source.

## Does it work?

ResXML is currently in an alpha state, primarily because the amount of
documentation and supporting infrastructure is minimal. That's not to
say it doesn't workâ€”the authors are already using it to produce
printed resumes for actual job applications. The problem is that you
need to know what you're doing. If you have the following:

* a working knowledge of XML;
* an XSLT processor; and (if you want PDF or PostScript output)
* an XSLFO formatter,

then you will be able to use ResXML to produce a resume.

## History

We originally developed ResXML in about 2003, and it was hosted on
SourceForge. This is _not_ a bit-for-bit copy of that repository, as
it contained quite a bit of Subversion- and SourceForge-related
detritus. We've moved the latest version of the important parts of
that repository over to GitHub, and left behind what wasn't required
or was no longer relevant.
